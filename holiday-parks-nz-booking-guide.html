            <p>Keep this checklist beside you in KiwiCamping while you compare powered and non-powered sites.</p>
            <a class="btn" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nz-camping-map-kiwicamping/id6746952595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open KiwiCamping</a>

          <h2>Types of sites and amenities</h2>
          <p>Holiday parks offer powered motorhome bays, unpowered tent sites, ensuite pitches, and cabins. Amenities range from kitchens, laundries, and dump stations to playgrounds, pools, and bike hire. KiwiCamping lists facility icons on every park page, so filter by “powered”, “family-friendly”, or “pet-friendly” before you book.</p>
          <p>Ask if the site includes water taps, greywater drains, or EV charging. Major networks include <strong>Holiday Parks NZ</strong> (~230+ member parks), <strong>TOP&nbsp;10 Holiday Parks</strong> (~50 parks), and <strong>Kiwi Holiday Parks</strong> (~40 parks). Many partners link directly from KiwiCamping listings for quick booking.</p>
          <p>Cross-check cabin options and accessible facilities. If the park doubles as a dump station, add it to your <a href="dump-stations-nz.html">waste management plan</a>.</p>

          <h2>Price ranges, peak vs shoulder season</h2>
          <p>Expect powered sites to cost roughly NZ$20-$30 per adult in shoulder season and NZ$30-$50+ in peak (site-based pricing can differ). Unpowered tent pads are often cheaper. Cabins vary widely: budget studios from ~$80, full apartments from ~$180+. KiwiCamping shows indicative bands where provided.</p>
          <p>Peak dates typically span mid‑December to early February (especially Christmas/New Year week) and long weekends. Shoulder season (Mar–May, Sep–Nov) offers availability and value. Parks near Abel Tasman, Queenstown, Rotorua, and Wanaka may require booking weeks ahead.</p>
          <p>Membership programmes such as TOP&nbsp;10 Club or Kiwi Holiday Parks discounts can save ~10%. Note that some operators add a 2-2.5% credit card surcharge. Third-party platforms may charge 2-15% commission. Booking direct can sometimes be cheaper or more flexible.</p>

          <h2>How to book online with partners</h2>
          <p>Follow this sequence to secure a site without phone calls:</p>
          <ol class="howto-steps">
            <li>Open the park in KiwiCamping and tap the booking link (e.g. <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/partner/top10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TOP 10</a> or <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/partner/bookit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BookIt</a>).</li>
            <li>Select your travel dates, number of adults/children, and vehicle details. Many booking engines ask for length and height. Measure accurately.</li>
            <li>Add extras like linen hire, Wi-Fi passes, or dog fees. Confirm whether the price includes dump station use.</li>
            <li>Pay the deposit (usually 10–25%) or the full rate. Save the confirmation PDF to your trip or share it with your group so everyone sees it offline.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you need personalised advice, call the park after submitting your request. They can recommend specific sites for large rigs or mobility access.</p>

          <h2>Cancellation and late-arrival policies</h2>
          <p>Typical policies: free changes up to 72&nbsp;hours-7&nbsp;days out, partial refunds inside that window, and no refunds close to arrival. Policies are stricter over peak. Always read the policy and store it with your trip in KiwiCamping.</p>
          <p>Arriving after reception hours? Notify the park in advance. They will provide a lockbox code or leave instructions in the late arrivals box. Add these details to your KiwiCamping trip so everyone in your convoy sees them.</p>
          <p>Bad weather forcing a change? Flip to our <a href="nz-camping-seasons-weather-sandflies.html">seasonality guide</a> for weather intel and call the park; many operators will shift dates in shoulder season to keep goodwill.</p>

              <dt>Can holiday parks hold parcels or groceries?</dt>
              <dd>Many will if you ask. Note the request in your booking and add the pickup details to KiwiCamping so travelling companions are in the loop.</dd>
              <dt>How do I guarantee a powered site for my EV campervan?</dt>
              <dd>Book early, mention your charging needs, and choose parks with dedicated EV or 16A power outlets. Cross-check with KiwiCamping amenity icons.</dd>
