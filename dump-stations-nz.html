            <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Always use official dump stations listed in KiwiCamping, carry the right hoses, and rinse pads to keep councils confident in freedom camping access.</p>

          <h2>How to find dump stations</h2>
          <p>KiwiCamping maps every council, holiday park, and private dump station in NZ. Use the filter toggle for “Dump stations” or tap the waste icon on any site listing. Many stations sit within holiday parks—check if public access is allowed or if a fee applies.</p>
          <p>When planning long drives, add dump stations to your trip list so navigation instructions are available offline. For rural areas, phone ahead to ensure the facility is operational—storm damage can occasionally close sites.</p>

          <h2>How to use them correctly</h2>
          <p>Follow the golden sequence: gloves on, park close without blocking lanes, connect your blackwater hose, open valves slowly, and rinse the pad afterwards. Never leave caps off the drains or hoses unattended.</p>
          <p>Carry a freshwater hose dedicated to rinsing tanks. Many stations provide taps, but BYO hardware ensures hygiene. If the station has a queue, keep your setup organised so you vacate quickly and let others in.</p>

          <h2>Greywater, blackwater, detergents</h2>
          <p>Greywater may look harmless, but councils classify it as wastewater. Empty it alongside blackwater and avoid dumping detergents or bleach outside official facilities. Choose biodegradable soaps, especially when staying near lakes or marine reserves.</p>
          <p>After emptying, flush tanks with fresh water and add treatment tablets if required. KiwiCamping’s notes show where to refill potable water—verify signage so you do not contaminate drinking taps.</p>

          <h2>Common fines and how to avoid issues</h2>
          <p>Dumping wastewater in stormwater drains or on roadsides can attract fines exceeding $200 and may jeopardise freedom camping access for everyone. Councils such as Queenstown-Lakes and Taupō actively monitor cameras near key stations.</p>
          <p>Keep receipts or photos if you pay to use private facilities; they help demonstrate compliance during inspections. Pair this guide with our <a href="self-contained-vehicles-nz.html">self-contained requirements</a> and <a href="freedom-camping-rules-nz.html">freedom camping rules</a> for end-to-end compliance.</p>

            <h3>Dump station FAQ</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>Do I have to pay to use dump stations?</dt>
              <dd>Most council stations are free; some holiday parks charge a small fee for non-guests. KiwiCamping lists costs when operators provide them.</dd>
              <dt>Can I empty greywater on the ground?</dt>
              <dd>No. Greywater must be disposed of at official dump stations to protect waterways and avoid fines.</dd>
              <dt>What if a dump station is closed?</dt>
              <dd>Use KiwiCamping to find the nearest alternative and notify the community via the app so others can reroute.</dd>
