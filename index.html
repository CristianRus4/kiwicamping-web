          <article>
            <h3>Speechify alternative</h3>
            <p>Unlike a typical text to speech reader, txtpod creates a private podcast feed so episodes appear in Apple Podcasts, Overcast, and Pocket Casts. Enjoy high quality AI voices with 30+ styles across 20+ languages.</p>

          </article>
          <article>

          <article>
            <h3>Matter alternative</h3>

            <h3>NaturalReader alternative</h3>
            <p>NaturalReader is a solid text to speech tool. txtpod is different because it outputs a private RSS feed so your narrated articles live in your podcast app with playlists, downloads, and speed control. txtpod voices sound natural thanks to high quality AI models.</p>
