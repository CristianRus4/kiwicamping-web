        <h2>Why KiwiCamping?</h2>
        <p>
          KiwiCamping combines official DOC (Department of Conservation, New Zealand Government) data, local council bylaws, NZTA updates, and on-the-ground community tips in one fast guide. Unlike generic camping directories, KiwiCamping is tuned for New Zealand: holiday parks, freedom camping rules, self-contained requirements, dump stations, and hut passes all rely on the latest verified information. Live weather forecasts, photo galleries, and traveller notes keep campervan crews, caravans, and backpackers confident wherever they're roaming across Aotearoa.

            <h1>Best Camping Apps for New Zealand in 2025</h1>
            <p class="lede">We downloaded, drove with, and benchmarked every major New Zealand camping app so you know exactly which one to trust for offline maps, freedom camping bylaws, DOC huts, and road-trip planning in 2025.</p>
          </header>

          <div class="definition-box" role="note">
            <strong>Featured snippet answer:</strong> The best camping app for New Zealand in 2025 is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nz-camping-map-kiwicamping/id6746952595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KiwiCamping</a> because it pairs council bylaw updates, DOC huts, holiday park amenities, and offline maps in one place, with smart filters for self-contained vehicles and dump stations.
          </div>

          <div class="download-banner">
            <p>Keep this guide open inside KiwiCamping by installing the app via the smart banner or tapping the button below.</p>
            <a class="btn" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nz-camping-map-kiwicamping/id6746952595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download KiwiCamping</a>
          </div>

          <p>We evaluated each contender against five pillars—data freshness, offline usability, compliance guidance, trip-planning power, and privacy—to help road trippers choose confidently. Tap back to the <a href="#features">KiwiCamping features</a> section if you want a fast overview of what the app already includes. If you need booking tactics once you have picked an app, jump to our <a href="#holiday-parks-nz-booking-guide">holiday park booking guide</a>.</p>

          <h2>Criteria used to rank apps</h2>
          <p>New Zealand’s camping landscape changes constantly: DOC publishes alerts weekly, councils release new freedom camping bylaws overnight, and storm damage can close a beloved campsite for months. Any app ranked here had to refresh its data at least monthly and cite official sources, otherwise travellers could end up with fines or wasted detours.</p>
          <p>Offline coverage weightings were doubled compared with past years. We tested each platform with devices in flight mode while driving Te Waipounamu and Te Ika-a-Māui. KiwiCamping cached DOC text, bylaws, amenities, and dump station notes, while several competitors only kept coarse maps. When you are far from reception, that difference is critical.</p>
          <p>Compliance guidance now includes how well an app differentiates between general freedom camping rules and self-contained only areas. With the self-contained vehicle regulations tightening, we marked down tools that simply tag a site “SC only” without linking to sources or providing verification steps.</p>
          <p>Trip planning was the fourth pillar. We looked for saved lists, routing, and collaboration features so groups can plan together. KiwiCamping’s unlimited lists and drag-and-drop stops outperform one-off bookmark systems from global apps.</p>
          <p>Finally, privacy and monetisation policies influenced rankings. Because users share location history and vehicle information, we read every privacy policy and noted if the app sells aggregated data. For a deeper look at how KiwiCamping handles data, review the <a href="http://cristianrus.me/apps/kiwicamping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy page</a>.</p>

          <h2>Top apps list with pros and cons</h2>
          <p>Below are the camping apps Kiwi travellers use most. Each entry lists real-world strengths and deal-breakers after thousands of kilometres of testing.</p>
          <ol class="ranked-list">
            <li>
              <strong>KiwiCamping</strong> – unmatched for compliance and offline depth. Pros: instant DOC updates, council bylaw summaries, trip planner, dump station filters, and in-app weather. Cons: currently iOS only, though Android is on the waitlist.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rankers</strong> – huge community review base. Pros: crowd photos, DOC partnership data. Cons: relies on reception and has fewer enforcement notes than KiwiCamping.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CamperMate</strong> – holiday park specialist. Pros: booking integrations, deals. Cons: categories can be cluttered, offline packs are limited.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>WikiCamps NZ</strong> – flexible filter engine. Pros: user-added POIs and Q&amp;A boards. Cons: inconsistent data verification and no official bylaw feed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AllTrails (NZ filters)</strong> – trampers’ companion. Pros: topo overlays and GPX exports. Cons: lacks dump stations, bylaws, and vehicle-focused info.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <figure class="asset-placeholder" role="presentation">
            <figcaption>Comparison table placeholder: visual table comparing KiwiCamping, Rankers, CamperMate, WikiCamps, and AllTrails against data freshness, offline availability, bylaws, trip planner, and price tiers.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Use the tap-to-open universal links inside KiwiCamping to jump from any site listing straight into Apple Maps driving directions. That workflow is significantly faster than copying GPS coordinates from other apps.</p>

          <h2>Offline maps and coverage by region</h2>
          <p>KiwiCamping’s offline bundles include all DOC campgrounds, huts, and bylaws for both islands. Sync over Wi-Fi before leaving Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, or Queenstown and you will have every rule on-device while roaming remote valleys.</p>
          <p>Rankers and CamperMate provide optional map tile downloads, but they do not package council bylaws or dump station notes. If you much prefer their interface, preload regional downloads and screenshot critical rule summaries from KiwiCamping as a backup.</p>
          <p>WikiCamps asks you to pick specific regions. In our testing, it missed smaller council updates in Taranaki and Southland. KiwiCamping stores the official PDF link for each bylaw so you can show compliance officers even when offline—tap “Council Source” inside the app listing.</p>

          <figure class="asset-placeholder" role="presentation">
            <figcaption>Screenshot placeholder: montage of KiwiCamping offline sync screen, trip planner list, and a DOC campsite detail page with bylaw link.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h2>Pricing comparison</h2>
          <p>KiwiCamping currently offers a generous free tier covering nationwide discovery, bylaws, and unlimited lists. An optional KiwiCamping Pro subscription unlocks collaborative trip sharing, weather layers, and additional photo storage. Compare that to CamperMate, which monetises via bookings and advertising, or WikiCamps, which uses a one-off licence fee.</p>
          <p>Rankers bundles premium tools inside a yearly Rankers+ subscription. The upgrade adds offline downloads but still omits the legal summaries KiwiCamping includes by default. AllTrails requires AllTrails+ for offline maps, and it still does not list dump stations.</p>
          <p>When considering cost, factor in roaming data, fines, and planning time. The more context an app gives you before you park, the fewer penalties you will pay. KiwiCamping’s proactive alerts have already saved countless travellers from $200 infringement tickets.</p>

          <h2>When each app is the right choice</h2>
          <p>Choose KiwiCamping if you want one app that handles freedom camping rules, DOC huts, booking research, and dump stations without signal. It is also the only tool layering enforcement notes, waitlists, and weather into the same interface.</p>
          <p>Pick Rankers when you primarily want community reviews and you are staying in well-connected destinations. Pair it with KiwiCamping for compliance checks. Use CamperMate or Holiday Park-specific apps when your trip is powered-site heavy and you want bundle deals—then return to our <a href="#holiday-parks-nz-booking-guide">holiday park booking HowTo</a> to lock in the best rates.</p>
          <p>For trampers carrying GPX devices, AllTrails is still useful, but run it alongside KiwiCamping to confirm hut availability and bylaws for vehicle-based legs. Every traveller should keep KiwiCamping installed because it is free, respectful of user privacy, and backed by official datasets.</p>

In New Zealand that privilege comes with obligations: you must comply with the Freedom Camping Act 2011, respect local bylaws, and leave no trace. The term covers parking in lay-bys, lakeside reserves, or council-designated car parks, not private farmland or national park huts.</p>
          <p>KiwiCamping tags every legal spot and pairs it with the relevant rule excerpt so you can prove compliance. Tap the site card, scroll to “Council Source,” and follow the PDF or map overlay before setting up for the night.</p>

          <h2>National rules vs council bylaws</h2>
          <p>Nationally, you need a certified self-contained vehicle unless the council explicitly allows non-self-contained setups. The Department of Internal Affairs enforces penalties up to $400 for breaching the Act. Councils layer their own bylaws on top, defining restricted zones, maximum stay lengths, and prohibited activities.</p>
          <p>The fastest way to confirm restrictions is with the <a href="#map-of-legal-sites">KiwiCamping legal sites map</a>. Councils such as Queenstown-Lakes update bylaws every season. KiwiCamping pushes those updates within hours, while static PDFs on council sites may hide in obscure directories.</p>
          <p>Remember that conservation land has its own rules under the Reserves Act and DOC management plans. If a reserve is marked “no overnighting,” you must move on even if a council map seems permissive.</p>

          <h2>Self-contained vehicle requirements overview</h2>
          <p>From December 2024, most urban and popular tourism areas require vehicles to meet the new self-containment standard with a fixed toilet. Portable toilets no longer qualify unless you are in a council-designated exception zone. Certification involves meeting water storage, wastewater, and venting requirements verified by a Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board (PGDB) approved certifier.</p>
          <p>Need a refresher on the hardware requirements? Jump to our <a href="#self-contained-vehicles-nz">self-contained vehicle explainer</a> for diagrams, checklists, and enforcement scenarios. Always carry your warrant card and display the new blue compliance label.</p>

          <h2>Regional quick reference, North Island</h2>
          <p><strong>Northland:</strong> Expect designated zones only. KiwiCamping lists every Far North and Whangārei District site with stay limits—usually 2 nights. Rangers actively patrol over summer.</p>
          <p><strong>Auckland:</strong> Freedom camping is heavily restricted. Most sites require self-contained certification and adherence to 6pm–9am time slots. Viaduct Harbour, Piha, and many bays are prohibited—check the KiwiCamping bylaw snippets.</p>
          <p><strong>Waikato &amp; Bay of Plenty:</strong> Mix of council reserves and holiday park alternatives. Tauranga allows limited sites, while Rotorua offers lakeside spots with strict signage. Always verify with the <a href="#best-nz-camping-apps">KiwiCamping app</a> map filter before settling in.</p>
          <p><strong>Gisborne &amp; Hawke’s Bay:</strong> East Coast councils allow specific beaches but often mandate overnight permits. KiwiCamping provides links where you can request those permits online.</p>
          <p><strong>Taranaki, Manawatū-Whanganui, Wellington:</strong> Coastal parking is often limited to self-contained vehicles with 48-hour maxima. Wellington City enforces no-camping zones around the CBD; use KiwiCamping to find legal harbour spots instead.</p>

          <h2>Regional quick reference, South Island</h2>
          <p><strong>Tasman &amp; Nelson:</strong> Permit-only zones dominate. Rangers check stickers at Kaiteriteri and Golden Bay daily in summer. KiwiCamping highlights permit kiosks and i-SITE offices with direct links.</p>
          <p><strong>Marlborough &amp; Kaikōura:</strong> Marlborough Sounds have DOC campsites rather than pure freedom sites—book ahead. Kaikōura has council-run car parks with fixed capacity; check live availability in KiwiCamping before arriving late.</p>
          <p><strong>Canterbury:</strong> Christchurch limits freedom camping to a handful of car parks. Mackenzie and Waitaki Districts are more permissive but require self-contained proof. KiwiCamping’s enforcement notes flag hotspots where fines are common.</p>
          <p><strong>Otago:</strong> Queenstown-Lakes and Central Otago councils enforce strict zones. Expect early morning checks. Dunedin City offers a balance of coastal reserves with 2-night limits—arrive before dusk to secure a space.</p>
          <p><strong>Southland &amp; Fiordland:</strong> Freedom camping near Milford Sound is prohibited; use DOC campsites instead. Southland District allows specific gravel lay-bys with GPS coordinates listed inside KiwiCamping.</p>

          <h2>How to check local signage on arrival</h2>
          <p>Even when you have researched online, final authority rests with posted signage. Pull in, scan for freedom camping boards, and photograph them for your records. Signage overrides outdated PDFs or map layers.</p>
          <p>KiwiCamping’s check-in workflow helps: open the site, confirm you see the same rules, and report discrepancies. The moderation team triages updates daily so fellow travellers and councils benefit.</p>
          <p>If signage contradicts what the app says, follow the sign. Then send feedback through the app so we can investigate. Councils sometimes install temporary restrictions after floods or events, and KiwiCamping flags those as “temporary closures” once confirmed.</p>

            <h1>Can You Camp for Free in NZ, Where It Is Legal and Safe</h1>
            <p class="lede">Free camping is still possible across Aotearoa if you understand the types of land that allow it, meet self-contained standards, and follow an etiquette checklist that keeps local communities happy.</p>
          </header>

          <div class="definition-box" role="note">
            <strong>Free camping in New Zealand</strong> means staying overnight without paying a campsite fee in locations authorised by the Freedom Camping Act, council bylaws, DOC concessions, or private owners. It never overrides posted signage.
          </div>

          <div class="download-banner">
            <p>Use the KiwiCamping app to filter for fee-free sites, verify bylaws, and download offline maps before you roll out.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Types of places that allow free camping</h2>
          <p>Public reserves specifically marked for freedom camping are the most reliable spots. Councils publish lists that KiwiCamping syncs, letting you browse by region and vehicle type. DOC also operates a handful of basic campsites that cost nothing; look for “standard” or “basic” DOC sites with a $0 fee tag in the app.</p>
          <p>Some communities provide designated car parks, gravel lay-bys, or showgrounds where self-contained vehicles can stay for one or two nights. KiwiCamping labels these as “council-managed” with notes on opening seasons.</p>
          <p>Private invitations—such as using a friend’s paddock—count as free camping too, but always obtain written permission. Never assume that remote farmland or forestry roads are fair game.</p>

          <h2>Typical restrictions and enforcement</h2>
          <p>Expect stay limits of 1–2 nights and arrival windows between 6pm and 9am. Noise curfews often apply. Councils like Queenstown-Lakes, Tauranga, and Kaikōura run evening and dawn patrols to check certification and signage compliance.</p>
          <p>Fines range from $200 to $400. Repeat offenders risk towing. The <a href="#freedom-camping-rules-nz">regional rules guide</a> explains the main hotspots, and KiwiCamping pushes notifications if a council changes enforcement intensity.</p>
          <p>Always read the local bylaw snippet within KiwiCamping. If the app notes “no overnight camping” or “permit required,” treat it seriously. Permits are usually free but must be applied for ahead of time.</p>

          <h2>Safety, etiquette, and noise rules</h2>
          <p>Free camping relies on trust. Keep vehicles discreet, arrive late, leave early, and avoid deploying awnings or spreading gear beyond your footprint unless signage allows it. Use KiwiCamping’s dump station filter to empty waste before arriving; lingering greywater odours quickly trigger complaints.</p>
          <p>Stick to small groups. Two vehicles are usually the maximum at urban freedom spots. Rotate destinations—if you stay somewhere longer than allowed, neighbours will escalate to council compliance teams.</p>
          <p>Respect mana whenua and local communities. If kaumātua or residents ask you to move on, do so respectfully and update the app listing so others learn from it.</p>

          <h2>How to verify legality before parking</h2>
          <p>Follow this quick sequence before you power down the engine:</p>
          <ol class="howto-steps">
            <li>Open KiwiCamping and filter for “Free” or “Freedom camping” sites. Save the spot to your trip plan.</li>
            <li>Read the bylaw excerpt and note stay limits, certification requirements, and curfews.</li>
            <li>Arrive before dark, check signage, and compare it to the app listing. Photograph the sign for future reference.</li>
            <li>Log a field note inside KiwiCamping if conditions have changed so the community and councils can update the rules.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If anything looks uncertain, proceed to a nearby DOC campsite or holiday park. Use our <a href="#holiday-parks-nz-booking-guide">booking guide</a> to grab a powered site as a backup plan.</p>

          <h2>National parks, conservation areas, council reserves, private parks</h2>
          <p>New Zealand’s camping network spans four primary land types. <strong>DOC-managed campsites and huts</strong> cover national parks, forest parks, and scenic reserves. They range from $0 basic sites to serviced campgrounds with wardens. Use KiwiCamping filters or dive into our <a href="#doc-campsites-huts-guide">DOC campsites and huts guide</a> to compare fees and booking rules.</p>
          <p><strong>Council reserves</strong> act as the backbone for freedom campers. They’re governed by local bylaws and typically allow one or two nights of self-contained stays. Tap the council badge inside KiwiCamping to read the exact clause before unpacking.</p>
          <p><strong>Private holiday parks</strong> provide powered sites, showers, laundries, and playgrounds. They’re ideal reset points between remote DOC stays. Once you identify a region, head over to the <a href="#holiday-parks-nz-booking-guide">holiday park booking tutorial</a> for step-by-step reservation tips.</p>
          <p><strong>Iwi, hapū, and community-managed locations</strong>—such as marae campgrounds or showgrounds—offer cultural experiences and support local guardianship. Respect tikanga, pay koha where requested, and confirm availability in advance through KiwiCamping contact links.</p>

          <h2>North Island regions overview</h2>
          <p>Northland’s coastline is dotted with DOC and council sites like <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-uralu-bay-campground" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ōpārara Estuary Campsite</a>, <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/council-tapu-bay-freedom-site" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tapu Bay Reserve</a>, and <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-spirits-bay-campground" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spirits Bay / Kapowairua</a>. Many require self-contained certification and close during significant cultural events—KiwiCamping flags those blackout periods.</p>
          <p>Auckland balances regional parks like Wenderholm (bookable via Auckland Council) with long-stay holiday parks such as <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/private-orewa-top-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ōrewa Beach TOP 10</a>. Waikato and the Coromandel offer beachfront DOC gems at <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-hoteo-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Opito Bay</a>, while Taupō and Rotorua mix geothermal holiday parks with lakeside freedom nodes.</p>
          <p>The central plateau highlights include <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-whakapapa-holiday-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whakapapa Holiday Park</a> for Tongariro adventures and free council spots around Turangi. On the east coast, Gisborne and Hawke’s Bay blend surf-side DOC camps with council-managed car parks. In Wellington, urban travellers rely on <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/council-evans-bay-motorhome-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evans Bay Motorhome Park</a> and ferry-friendly holiday parks.</p>

          <h2>South Island regions overview</h2>
          <p>Marlborough’s Queen Charlotte Drive features DOC and concession sites such as <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-mistletoe-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mistletoe Bay Eco Village</a> and <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-elnor-ferry-campsite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momorangi Bay</a>. Nelson Tasman blends Golden Bay council sites with iconic DOC campgrounds in Abel Tasman National Park.</p>
          <p>West Coast wanderers should queue up <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-lake-mahinapua" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake Mahinapua DOC Campsite</a> and <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-gillespies-beach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gillespies Beach</a>. Canterbury offers braided river freedom zones alongside holiday parks in Tekapo and Kaikōura. Cross-reference flood alerts using KiwiCamping’s weather integrations.</p>
          <p>Otago and Southland boast icons such as <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-moke-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moke Lake</a>, <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-curio-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curio Bay</a>, and <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-monowai-campsite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monowai Campsite</a>. Remember that Milford Sound and Fiordland largely require DOC bookings—freedom camping isn’t permitted close to the fiords.</p>
          <p>For scenic inspiration and photo-ready picks, skip ahead to our <a href="#top-scenic-campsites-nz">Top 25 scenic campsite list</a>, which links directly into the KiwiCamping map.</p>

          <h2>Seasonal access and weather considerations</h2>
          <p>Winter brings snow and ice to alpine passes. Many DOC roads close temporarily after heavy snow in Arthur’s Pass, Lindis Pass, or the Desert Road. Use KiwiCamping weather alerts and road closures to time your travel, and pack according to our <a href="#camping-packing-list-nz">regional packing list</a>.</p>
          <p>Summer popularity can overwhelm coastal DOC sites—book early and keep holiday park backups handy. Autumn and spring shoulder seasons are perfect for quieter stays but can deliver unpredictable rain. Keep KiwiCamping’s offline lists up to date so you can pivot when cyclones or nor’westers hit.</p>
          <p>Always respect rāhui and local tikanga. KiwiCamping highlights cultural restrictions. If a site shows a rāhui banner, choose an alternative and spread the word to other travellers.</p>

            <h1>Holiday Parks in New Zealand, How to Choose and Book</h1>
            <p class="lede">Pick the right powered site, lock it in at the best rate, and arrive after hours without stress using this step-by-step booking workflow.</p>
          </header>

          <div class="definition-box" role="note">
            <p><strong>Quick definition:</strong> A New Zealand holiday park is a privately or community-operated campground offering powered pads, communal facilities, and cabin upgrades. Booking requires selecting your region, site type, vehicle length, and arrival window.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="download-banner">
            <p>Keep this checklist beside you in KiwiCamping while you compare powered and non-powered sites.</p>
            <a class="btn" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nz-camping-map-kiwicamping/id6746952595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open KiwiCamping</a>
          </div>

          <h2>Types of sites and amenities</h2>
          <p>Holiday parks offer powered motorhome bays, unpowered tent sites, ensuite pitches, and cabins. Amenities range from kitchens, laundries, and dump stations to playgrounds, pools, and bike hire. KiwiCamping lists facility icons on every park page, so filter by “powered”, “family-friendly”, or “pet-friendly” before you book.</p>
          <p>Ask if the site includes water taps, greywater drains, or EV charging. Many premium operators such as <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/partner/top10-holiday-parks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TOP 10 Holiday Parks</a>, <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/partner/holiday-parks-nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holiday Parks NZ</a>, and <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/private-kiwi-holiday-park-fox-glacier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiwi Holiday Parks</a> partner directly with KiwiCamping, letting you tap through from the listing.</p>
          <p>Cross-check cabin options and accessible facilities. If the park doubles as a dump station, add it to your <a href="#dump-stations-nz">waste management plan</a>.</p>

          <h2>Price ranges, peak vs shoulder season</h2>
          <p>Expect powered sites to cost NZD $25–$45 per adult in shoulder season and $35–$65 over Christmas or public holidays. Unpowered tent pads run $15–$25 off-peak. Cabins vary widely—budget studios from $80, full apartments from $180+. KiwiCamping includes indicative price bands and will note seasonal surcharges where operators provide them.</p>
          <p>Shoulder season (March–May and September–November) delivers the best balance of availability and weather. In peak months, parks near Abel Tasman, Queenstown, Rotorua, and Wanaka may require booking weeks ahead. Use our <a href="#best-nz-camping-apps">best camping apps roundup</a> to compare alternative platforms if your first choice is full.</p>
          <p>Membership programmes such as TOP 10 Club, Kiwi Holiday Parks Rewards, or Tasman Holiday Parks Club can lower nightly rates by 10–20%. Add membership numbers to your KiwiCamping trip notes so you have them ready when booking online.</p>

          <h2>How to book online with partners</h2>
          <p>Follow this sequence to secure a site without phone calls:</p>
          <ol class="howto-steps">
            <li>Open the park in KiwiCamping and tap the booking link (e.g. <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/partner/top10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TOP 10</a> or <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/partner/bookit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BookIt</a>).</li>
            <li>Select your travel dates, number of adults/children, and vehicle details. Many booking engines ask for length and height—measure accurately.</li>
            <li>Add extras like linen hire, Wi-Fi passes, or dog fees. Confirm whether the price includes dump station use.</li>
            <li>Pay the deposit (usually 10–25%) or the full rate. Save the confirmation PDF into KiwiCamping notes or your trip-share so everyone sees it offline.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you need personalised advice, call the park after submitting your request. They can recommend specific sites for large rigs or mobility access.</p>

          <h2>Cancellation and late-arrival policies</h2>
          <p>Most parks allow free cancellation up to 7 days out, with 50% refunds between 7–2 days, and no refund within 48 hours. Peak season policies can be stricter. Always read the fine print on the booking confirmation and store it inside the KiwiCamping trip card.</p>
          <p>Arriving after reception hours? Notify the park in advance. They will provide a lockbox code or leave instructions in the late arrivals box. Add these details to your KiwiCamping notes so everyone in your convoy sees them.</p>
          <p>Bad weather forcing a change? Flip to our <a href="#nz-camping-seasons-weather-sandflies">seasonality guide</a> for weather intel and call the park; many operators will shift dates in shoulder season to keep goodwill.</p>

            <p class="lede">Decode the Department of Conservation booking system, fees, and hut etiquette so you always arrive prepared and respectful.</p>
          </header>

          <div class="download-banner">
            <p>Bookmark this DOC guide inside KiwiCamping—every hut link below opens directly in the app with offline info.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>What DOC manages</h2>
          <p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) oversees more than 200 campsites and 950 huts across Aotearoa, from Great Walk lodges to backcountry bivvies. Within KiwiCamping you can search the full DOC database, check alerts, and open official web pages when needed.</p>
          <p>DOC also manages track maintenance, hut passes, and seasonal closures. Before heading into the backcountry, review avalanche advisories and track status updates inside the app. Pair this guide with our <a href="#nz-camping-seasons-weather-sandflies">weather and seasonality</a> article to time your trip.</p>

          <h2>Campsite categories and fees</h2>
          <p>DOC campsites fall into five price tiers: Basic (free), Standard ($8–$16 per adult), Scenic ($15–$18), Serviced ($20–$25), and Serviced with power ($25–$40). KiwiCamping listings display the current adult, child, and infant rates and note if bookings are required.</p>
          <p>Popular sites like <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-punakaiki-beach-camp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Punakaiki Beach Camp</a> or <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-kidneys-beach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinloch Campsite</a> accept online bookings. Remote Basic camps such as <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/site/doc-lake-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake Stream Campsite</a> remain first-come, first-served—carry cash for honesty boxes where applicable.</p>
          <p>Many scenic and serviced camps include DOC-managed dump stations. Use our <a href="#dump-stations-nz">dump station guide</a> to plan waste disposal without leaving the park network.</p>

          <h2>Huts categories, tickets, booking seasons</h2>
          <p>DOC huts range from free Bivvies to premium Great Walk lodges. KiwiCamping labels each with the official category, required tickets or passes, and booking windows. For example, <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/hut/routeburn-falls-hut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Routeburn Falls Hut</a> opens bookings in May for the November–April Great Walk season, while <a href="https://campingapp.nz/link/hut/angelus-hut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angelus Hut</a> uses the general online booking system year-round.</p>
          <p>Backcountry Hut Passes cover most standard huts but not Great Walks. Purchase passes online, at DOC visitor centres, or via select i-SITEs. Save your pass number in KiwiCamping trip notes so wardens can verify it quickly.</p>
          <p>Shoulder seasons often use a “first in, first served” model even on popular tracks. Always check alerts before leaving—storms or slips can close huts temporarily.</p>

          <h2>Hut etiquette and occupancy tips</h2>
          <p>Carry out all rubbish, sweep before you leave, and leave wet gear outside bunks. Arrive early to secure bunks on non-bookable nights and pack earplugs for communal rooms. If you reach capacity, be prepared to camp outside in a tent—DOC expects travellers to carry a backup shelter.</p>
          <p>Use LPG sparingly and share cooking benches during peak hours. Respect quiet hours (usually 9pm–6am) and keep devices on silent. If your crew runs late, notify the hut warden via DOC or KiwiCamping contact details.</p>
          <p>Pair this etiquette with our <a href="#camping-packing-list-nz">tramping packing list</a> so you have headlamps, hut tickets, and emergency options ready.</p>

            <h1>Self-Contained Vehicles in NZ, What It Really Requires</h1>
            <p class="lede">Everything you need to pass New Zealand’s updated self-containment certification, from fixed toilets and venting to inspection paperwork.</p>
          </header>

          <div class="definition-box" role="note">
            <p><strong>Self-contained vehicle definition:</strong> A vehicle that meets NZS 5465:2023 with permanently plumbed fresh water, wastewater, and toilet systems capable of supporting occupants for at least three days without discharging waste.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="download-banner">
            <p>Use KiwiCamping to track certified sites, find inspection agents, and store your certification details.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>What self-contained certification means</h2>
          <p>Certification proves your vehicle can manage water and waste without relying on public facilities. As of December 2024, only vehicles with fixed toilets connected to a holding tank qualify for blue warrants. Portable cassette toilets no longer meet the standard except in limited rural exemptions.</p>
          <p>Approved testing officers inspect your freshwater storage (minimum 12 litres per person), wastewater capacity (20% greater than freshwater), sinks, vents, and signage. KiwiCamping lists PGDB-approved inspectors regionally so you can book ahead.</p>

          <h2>Fixed toilet vs portable, water and waste standards overview</h2>
          <p>The updated regulations require a fixed toilet with direct plumbing to a sealed blackwater tank. Cassette systems must be bolted in place and vented externally. Freshwater tanks need secure caps and food-grade hoses. Wastewater outlets must be labelled and capped.</p>
          <p>Greywater tanks require external vents and a 3-day capacity. Use food-safe hoses and ensure the sink drains pass the bucket test during inspection. For design tips, consult manufacturers or community builds featured inside KiwiCamping.</p>

          <h2>How enforcement typically works</h2>
          <p>Compliance officers from councils or the national freedom camping team can request to see your self-containment warrant, inspection certificate, and matching vehicle registration. KiwiCamping recommends storing digital copies in your trip notes.</p>
          <p>Failure to produce documentation or displaying an outdated green sticker can lead to $200 fines or being moved on. Hotspots like Queenstown, Rotorua, and Christchurch run frequent checks, especially during peak summers.</p>

          <h2>Implications for freedom camping</h2>
          <p>Most urban freedom sites now demand blue-warranted vehicles. Rural councils may allow non-certified campers in designated areas, but you must remove wastewater daily. Cross-reference our <a href="#freedom-camping-rules-nz">freedom camping rules by region</a> guide to stay legal.</p>
          <p>Even when self-contained, you must dispose of waste responsibly. Plan stops using the <a href="#dump-stations-nz">dump station map</a> and keep greywater valves sealed while driving.</p>

          <p>KiwiCamping maps every council, holiday park, and private dump station in NZ. Use the filter toggle for “Dump stations” or tap the waste icon on any site listing. Many stations sit within holiday parks—check if public access is allowed or if a fee applies.</p>
          <p>When planning long drives, add dump stations to your trip list so navigation instructions are available offline. For rural areas, phone ahead to ensure the facility is operational—storm damage can occasionally close sites.</p>

          <h2>How to use them correctly</h2>
          <p>Follow the golden sequence: gloves on, park close without blocking lanes, connect your blackwater hose, open valves slowly, and rinse the pad afterwards. Never leave caps off the drains or hoses unattended.</p>
          <p>Carry a freshwater hose dedicated to rinsing tanks. Many stations provide taps, but BYO hardware ensures hygiene. If the station has a queue, keep your setup organised so you vacate quickly and let others in.</p>

          <h2>Greywater, blackwater, detergents</h2>
          <p>Greywater may look harmless, but councils classify it as wastewater. Empty it alongside blackwater and avoid dumping detergents or bleach outside official facilities. Choose biodegradable soaps, especially when staying near lakes or marine reserves.</p>
          <p>After emptying, flush tanks with fresh water and add treatment tablets if required. KiwiCamping’s notes show where to refill potable water—verify signage so you do not contaminate drinking taps.</p>

          <h2>Common fines and how to avoid issues</h2>
          <p>Dumping wastewater in stormwater drains or on roadsides can attract fines exceeding $200 and may jeopardise freedom camping access for everyone. Councils such as Queenstown-Lakes and Taupō actively monitor cameras near key stations.</p>
          <p>Keep receipts or photos if you pay to use private facilities; they help demonstrate compliance during inspections. Pair this guide with our <a href="#self-contained-vehicles-nz">self-contained requirements</a> and <a href="#freedom-camping-rules-nz">freedom camping rules</a> for end-to-end compliance.</p>

            <h3>Dump station FAQ</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>Do I have to pay to use dump stations?</dt>
              <dd>Most council stations are free; some holiday parks charge a small fee for non-guests. KiwiCamping lists costs when operators provide them.</dd>
              <dt>Can I empty greywater on the ground?</dt>
              <dd>No. Greywater must be disposed of at official dump stations to protect waterways and avoid fines.</dd>
              <dt>What if a dump station is closed?</dt>
              <dd>Use KiwiCamping to find the nearest alternative and notify the community via the app so others can reroute.</dd>

            <h1>Fire Rules, Bans, and Safe Cooking Outdoors</h1>
            <p class="lede">Avoid fines and wildfire risk by understanding New Zealand’s fire seasons, permit system, and safe cooking alternatives.</p>
          </header>

          <div class="definition-box" role="note">
            <strong>Remember:</strong> Open fires are illegal in many regions without a permit during restricted or prohibited fire seasons. Gas cookers are usually allowed, but always verify local alerts.</div>

          <div class="download-banner">
            <p>Enable KiwiCamping’s fire danger alerts and save hotline numbers before you travel.</p>
            <a class="btn" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nz-camping-map-kiwicamping/id6746952595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open KiwiCamping</a>
          </div>

          <h2>Open fires vs gas cookers</h2>
          <p>Open fires include campfires, wood burners, and charcoal grills. They require permits in restricted fire seasons and are banned outright in prohibited periods. Gas cookers with an on/off valve are typically allowed, but some councils ban them on high-risk days.</p>
          <p>Check the Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) website or tap the fire widget in KiwiCamping for real-time status. If in doubt, cook with a gas stove on a stable surface away from vegetation.</p>

          <h2>Seasonal fire danger and permits overview</h2>
          <p>New Zealand operates three fire seasons: open, restricted, and prohibited. During restricted seasons you must apply for a permit via FENZ. KiwiCamping links to the permit form for each region and displays the season status in campsite cards.</p>
          <p>Permits specify fire type, location, and safety measures. Carry a printed or digital copy to show rangers. Remember that national park rules can be stricter than regional policies.</p>

          <h2>Region by region quick notes</h2>
          <p><strong>Northland &amp; Auckland:</strong> Coastal winds escalate fire danger. Expect restricted seasons through summer and early autumn. Use gas only unless FENZ issues a permit.</p>
          <p><strong>Central Plateau:</strong> Volcanic soils dry quickly. Campsites near Tongariro often sit in restricted zones even in spring.</p>
          <p><strong>Nelson-Tasman &amp; Marlborough:</strong> High sunshine hours mean frequent total fire bans. Many DOC sites provide gas BBQ shelters—book early.</p>
          <p><strong>Canterbury &amp; Otago:</strong> Nor’west winds cause sudden danger spikes. Check KiwiCamping alerts daily and consider alternative cooking methods.</p>
          <p><strong>Southland &amp; West Coast:</strong> Rain lowers risk, but storms can topple trees and create fuel loads. Follow ranger instructions.</p>

          <h2>Alternatives when fires are banned</h2>
          <p>Use gas cookers, induction hotplates with inverter setups, or pre-cooked meals. Carry cold-soak options in case total bans include camp stoves. Refer to our <a href="#camping-packing-list-nz">packing list guide</a> for stove recommendations and fire-safe gear.</p>
          <p>If you rely on communal camp kitchens, prioritise holiday parks or DOC camps with electric facilities—search KiwiCamping filters for “kitchen” or “BBQ shelter.” Cross-reference with regional weather in the <a href="#nz-camping-seasons-weather-sandflies">seasonality guide</a>.</p>

              <dt>Are gas BBQs allowed during a total fire ban?</dt>

            <p class="lede">Plan the perfect itinerary by aligning weather patterns, sandfly zones, and seasonal gear requirements across both islands.</p>

          <h2>Seasonality by island and region</h2>
          <p><strong>North Island:</strong> Summer (Dec–Feb) brings warm temps in Northland and the Coromandel, though humidity can trigger afternoon showers. Autumn offers calm, settled weather in Hawke’s Bay and Taranaki, making it ideal for campervan roadies. Winter is mild near Wellington and Taranaki but cooler inland.</p>
          <p><strong>South Island:</strong> Summer offers long daylight, but alpine UV is intense—pack sun shelter. Autumn colours shine in Central Otago, while spring delivers wild weather swings. Winter sees snow on passes such as Lindis and Arthur’s—carry chains and follow live alerts in KiwiCamping.</p>

          <h2>Rain, wind, and temperature bands</h2>
          <p>Expect 20–30°C highs in Northland during summer, while Southland ranges from 16–22°C. Winter lows can drop below freezing inland. Westerly fronts bring heavy rain to Fiordland and the West Coast year-round, whereas Canterbury and the east coast stay drier.</p>
          <p>Monitor wind forecasts—Canterbury nor’westers and Wellington southerlies can impact tent setup. KiwiCamping overlays Apple Weather data on each site, so you get hourly wind gust predictions.</p>

          <h2>Sandfly management tactics without harsh chemicals</h2>
          <p>Sandflies thrive on the West Coast, Fiordland, and Stewart Island. Wear light, long-sleeved layers, use natural repellents with citronella or picaridin, and avoid riverside camps at dawn/dusk. Install fine-mesh screens on camper windows.</p>
          <p>Inside KiwiCamping, look for sandfly notes on each listing. The community frequently updates severity reports, so you can plan stops with lower pressure.</p>

          <h2>Clothing and gear selection by season</h2>
          <p>Summer: breathable shirts, sun hats, and quick-dry shorts. Bring lightweight thermals for alpine nights. Autumn: add softshell jackets and waterproof layers—conditions shift quickly. Winter: full thermal base layers, down insulation, waterproof boots, and heated blankets for powered sites. Spring: mix of summer gear and waterproof shells for sudden showers.</p>

          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Navigation: KiwiCamping offline maps, paper atlas backup, compass.</li>
            <li>Shelter: tent or camper setup, ground mat, mallet, repair kit.</li>
            <li>Sleep system: sleeping bag rated to -5°C, liner, inflatable or foam mat.</li>
            <li>Cooking: gas stove, fuel canisters, lighter, biodegradable soap.</li>
            <li>Power: USB chargers, power bank, campsite RCD lead.</li>
            <li>Hygiene: microfibre towels, eco toiletries, compact first-aid kit.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Additions for alpine, coastal, West Coast rain</h2>
          <p><strong>Alpine:</strong> crampons or microspikes, avalanche gear, four-season tent, down parka. Keep our <a href="#doc-campsites-huts-guide">DOC hut guide</a> handy if you are heading into high country huts.</p>
          <p><strong>Coastal:</strong> sand pegs, sun shelters, rash shirts, extra guy ropes, and breathable layers.</p>
          <p><strong>West Coast rain:</strong> heavy-duty raincoats, gaiters, quick-dry base layers, spare tarps. Store electronics in dry bags and rotate footgear daily.</p>

          <h2>Food, water, and storage</h2>
          <p>Plan three days’ worth of meals plus an emergency reserve. Use stackable crates, vacuum-sealed portions, and collapsible water containers. KiwiCamping lists potable water taps and supermarkets near each site—add them to your trip plan for resupply days.</p>
          <p>Carry insulated bottles in winter and hydration bladders in summer. If freedom camping, keep wastewater containers sealed until you reach a dump station.</p>

          <h2>Navigation, comms, emergency</h2>
          <p>Download KiwiCamping for offline navigation, then pair it with PLBs, VHF radios, or Garmin inReach where coverage is thin. Carry printed DOC maps for multi-day tramps and share your itinerary using KiwiCamping’s trip sharing feature.</p>
          <p>Emergency kit essentials: PLB, whistle, headlamp with spare batteries, emergency blanket, multi-tool, duct tape, and basic repair supplies. Review our <a href="#self-contained-vehicles-nz">self-contained guide</a> to ensure your vehicle meets legal requirements if you rely on onboard systems.</p>

          </header>

            <p>Add this code of conduct to your KiwiCamping trip plan so every driver in your convoy stays aligned.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Leave No Trace principles adapted to NZ</h2>
          <p>Plan ahead with DOC alerts, KiwiCamping offline data, and local council bylaws. Travel and camp on durable surfaces, dispose of waste properly using <a href="#dump-stations-nz">dump stations</a>, leave what you find, minimise campfire impacts (see our <a href="#campfire-rules-nz">fire rules</a>), respect wildlife, and be considerate of others.</p>
          <p>Pack out all rubbish—including food scraps. Many councils operate pack-in, pack-out systems even at serviced sites. Keep biodegradable items out of the bush to avoid introducing pests.</p>

          <h2>Wildlife and biosecurity considerations</h2>
          <p>Clean boots and gear to stop kauri dieback and myrtle rust. Obey dog restrictions; many beaches and reserves prohibit dogs during nesting seasons. Do not feed kea, weka, or dolphins—human food disrupts behaviour and can be fatal.</p>
          <p>Follow rāhui and customary closures. KiwiCamping highlights these notices; treat them as non-negotiable to honour mana whenua.</p>

          <h2>Staying on formed sites and tracks</h2>
          <p>Stick to marked campsites and established parking pads. Parking on fragile tussock, dunes, or wetlands causes erosion. Use KiwiCamping’s sat imagery and site photos to position your vehicle without damaging vegetation.</p>
          <p>When tramping, stay on marked tracks. Cutting corners or creating new paths accelerates erosion, especially in alpine zones.</p>

          <h2>Community expectations near towns</h2>
          <p>Urban freedom spots come with local community agreements: keep noise down after 9pm, avoid generator use, and leave promptly by 9am. Support local cafes, refill at nearby fuel stations, and share tourism dollars in exchange for hospitality.</p>
          <p>If you see misuse, report it through KiwiCamping’s feedback tools so councils can act quickly without shutting sites permanently.</p>

          <h2>Access notes, amenities, booking status</h2>
          <p>Many DOC sites above are first-come-first-served—arrive early in summer and keep <a href="#holiday-parks-nz-booking-guide">holiday park backups</a> on standby. Holiday parks offer powered sites, hot showers, and laundries, while council freedom spots usually have limited facilities.</p>
          <p>Check KiwiCamping for road access warnings: Totaranui requires a long gravel drive, Lake Pukaki freedom sites can close due to conservation work, and Knobs Flat has sandfly hotspots. Download the <a href="#best-nz-camping-apps">KiwiCamping app</a> to store these notes offline.</p>

          <p>Save all 14 site links into a KiwiCamping trip list. Mix of DOC, council, and powered holiday parks ensures showers every few days. If a site is full, refer to the <a href="#top-scenic-campsites-nz">scenic list</a> or <a href="#holiday-parks-nz-booking-guide">booking guide</a> for backups.</p>

          <h2>Fuel, grocery, and dump station plan</h2>

          <h2>Reserve vs no-reserve nights</h2>
          <p>Book holiday parks (Days 1–3, 5, 9, 13–14) in advance during summer. DOC sites like Totaranui, Gillespies Beach, Moke Lake, and Knobs Flat may require reservations in peak season—check KiwiCamping to confirm.</p>
          <p>Freedom or first-come nights (Days 4, 7, 8, 10, 12) need backups. Keep <a href="#freedom-camping-rules-nz">freedom camping rules</a> handy in case you need to adjust.</p>

          <h2>Holiday park prices, DOC fees, free options</h2>
          <p>Holiday parks average $25–$45 per adult for powered sites in shoulder season and $35–$65 in summer. Cabins add $80+ per night. Our <a href="#holiday-parks-nz-booking-guide">booking guide</a> explains loyalty discounts and free cancellation windows.</p>
          <p>DOC camps range from free basic sites to $25 for serviced options with hot showers. Freedom camping can be $0 but may require self-contained certification. Use KiwiCamping to note any permit fees or donation boxes.</p>

          <h2>Fuel, ferry, food, gear amortization</h2>
          <p>Fuel remains a major cost—budget $0.30–$0.45 per kilometre for diesel and $0.35–$0.55 for petrol, depending on vehicle size. The Interislander or Bluebridge ferry for a campervan costs $250–$350 each way in peak periods.</p>
          <p>Food expenses vary with cooking habits: self-catered meals cost $15–$25 per person per day, while dining out can double that. Gear amortisation (tents, stoves, sleeping bags) might add $5–$10 per person per day when spread over a season.</p>

          <h2>Peak vs shoulder season budgets</h2>
          <p>Peak season (Dec–Feb) increases accommodation and ferry prices by 20–40%. Fuel demand also rises. Shoulder seasons offer discounts, fewer crowds, and easier bookings. Winter saves money but requires investment in warm gear—see the <a href="#camping-packing-list-nz">packing checklist</a> for insulating layers.</p>
          <p>Balance free nights with paid stays to access facilities. KiwiCamping’s trip planner makes it easy to visualise spend across two-week itineraries.</p>

          <h2>Example budgets for solo, couple, family</h2>
          <p><strong>Solo traveller (14 days):</strong> $550 accommodation (mix of DOC and occasional holiday park), $420 food, $450 fuel, $100 activities = approx $1,520.</p>
          <p><strong>Couple (14 days):</strong> $700 accommodation, $560 food, $600 fuel, $300 activities = approx $2,160 ($77 per person per day).</p>
          <p><strong>Family of four (14 days):</strong> $1,200 accommodation (powered sites + cabins), $1,120 food, $700 fuel, $500 activities = approx $3,520.</p>
          <p>Use KiwiCamping’s notes to record actual receipts and adjust for exchange rates if you are visiting from overseas.</p>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What is KiwiCamping?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>KiwiCamping is an offline NZ camping app with 3,500+ DOC campsites, huts, dump stations, and holiday parks. It is built for campers, vanlifers, trampers, and travellers exploring Aotearoa.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does KiwiCamping work offline?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>Yes. Download the official DOC and council site info once and you can search, filter, and read details without coverage. Maps and live weather still need reception, but the campsite, hut, holiday park, and rule info stays on your device.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How often are sites updated?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>We refresh DOC, council, and NZTA data regularly and publish community updates fast so you always have current information on closures, alerts, and new facilities.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does KiwiCamping include DOC huts?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>Yes. Every DOC hut pulls from official Department of Conservation information, including passes, capacity, access notes, track grades, and Great Walk booking links.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can I see freedom camping rules?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>Each freedom camping zone lists council bylaws, self-contained requirements, stay limits, and enforcement tips sourced from official regulations.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does KiwiCamping list dump stations?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>Dump stations and potable water points are mapped nationwide with notes on vehicle access, opening hours, and facilities drawn from council data.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does KiwiCamping show holiday parks and campervan parks?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>Yes. Holiday parks, campervan parks, and caravan-friendly campgrounds feature detailed amenities, powered sites, indicative pricing notes, and contact info alongside DOC huts and campsites.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can I plan road trips?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>Yes. Add sites to your trip planner, reorder stops, and create as many lists as you want for future campervan, caravan, or tent adventures. Plans stay on your device, and you can open any stop in Apple Maps or Google Maps when you are ready to drive.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What does self-contained mean in New Zealand?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>Self-contained vehicles carry certified fresh water, wastewater, and toilet systems that meet NZS 5465 standards. KiwiCamping explains whether each campsite or freedom spot requires self-contained certification so you know if your setup qualifies.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">

            <div class="faq-body">

            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do I need reception for weather or maps?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>Campsite, hut, and rule information stays offline, but live Apple Weather forecasts, tides, safety alerts, and streaming map tiles require an internet connection.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Where does KiwiCamping source its rules and alerts?</summary>
            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>Freedom camping bylaws, self-contained requirements, alerts, and closures come directly from the Department of Conservation, New Zealand councils, and NZTA notices.</p>
