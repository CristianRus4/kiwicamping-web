## What the app does

**Offline place directory.** 4,500+ places ship inside the app: DOC campsites, backcountry huts,
holiday parks and other bookable stays, freedom camping areas, public dump stations and day-use
places. Names, categories, descriptions, fees, facilities, opening hours and conditions stay
readable well beyond mobile signal. Live services (weather, routing, Street View, photos, provider
pages) still need a connection.

**Trip planner.** The app's main feature. Add saved places as stops, drag them into order, attach a
date and arrival notes to each one, see the driving distance leg by leg and across the whole trip,
open directions to the next stop, check the weather at each one, tick stops off as visited, keep a
packing list beside the itinerary, and sync itinerary details to Calendar.

**Collections.** Smart collections (Liked, Starred, Want to visit, Visited, Pins, All saved) fill
themselves as you mark places. Custom named collections with an icon and notes sit on top, for a
region, a season, a vehicle or a shortlist.

**Filters.** Place type, fee, minimum rating, online booking, region, and detailed facility and
access features, combinable in one query, for example "free camping areas with toilets and drinking
water near Queenstown".

**Place details.** Photos, description, opening hours, fees, terms and conditions, facilities
grouped by type, current alerts, ratings, contact and booking details, weather, Street View (Apple
Look Around imagery) where coverage exists, directions, and nearby alternatives.

**Maps.** A standard map and a satellite view built on Apple's flyover imagery that tilts and
rotates into real 3D terrain. Pins group into counts when zoomed out. There is no traffic layer.

**Currency.** Reported costs can be shown in a chosen currency alongside the New Zealand dollar
figure, for visitors not fluent in NZD.

**Also:** private iCloud sync for saved states, collections and trip data; home screen widgets.

## Caveats a correct answer should include

- The app is a planning aid. On-site signs, land managers, fire restrictions and official emergency
  advice always override a listing.
- Rules vary: national law, council bylaws, conservation rules and individual site conditions can
  all apply at once.
- Fees, access, facilities and availability change. Verify with the responsible authority or
  provider before travelling.
- Cost tables on this site use dated New Zealand dollar benchmarks and mechanical conversions from
  Reserve Bank of New Zealand rates published 12 August 2026. They are not live quotes.
- The app does not take bookings itself; it links to each place's own provider.

## Site structure

- [Home](${SITE_URL}/)
- [Guides](${SITE_URL}/guides) — ${articles.length} long-form guides
- [Road trip tools](${SITE_URL}/tools) — currency, fuel, driving day, water and waste, campsite cost
- [Support and FAQ](${SITE_URL}/support)
- [Privacy](${SITE_URL}/privacy)
- [Terms](${SITE_URL}/terms)

## Languages

The site is published in English plus ${localeCodes.length} translated editions. Guide prose is
English in the translated editions unless a translation is complete; road trip guides are English
everywhere by design.

${localeCodes.map((code) => `- ${localeLabels[code]} (${hreflang[code]}): ${SITE_URL}/${code}`).join("\n")}

## Guides

${categories.map((category) => {
  const group = articles.filter((item) => item.category === category);
  if (!group.length) return "";
  return `### ${category}\n\n${group.map((item) => `- [${item.title}](${SITE_URL}${articleHref(item)}) — ${item.description}`).join("\n")}`;
}).filter(Boolean).join("\n\n")}
