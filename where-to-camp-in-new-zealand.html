          <h2>National parks, conservation areas, council reserves, private parks</h2>
          <p>New Zealand’s camping network spans four primary land types. <strong>DOC-managed campsites and huts</strong> (320+ camps and ~950 huts) cover national parks, forest parks, and scenic reserves. They range from $0 basic sites to serviced campgrounds with wardens. Use KiwiCamping filters or dive into our <a href="doc-campsites-huts-guide.html">DOC campsites and huts guide</a> to compare fees and booking rules.</p>
          <p><strong>Council reserves</strong> act as the backbone for freedom campers. They’re governed by local bylaws and typically allow one or two nights, often for <em>certified self-contained</em> (CSC) vehicles only. Tap the council badge inside KiwiCamping to read the exact clause before unpacking.</p>
          <p><strong>Private holiday parks</strong> provide powered sites, showers, laundries, and playgrounds. They’re ideal reset points between remote DOC stays. Once you identify a region, head over to the <a href="holiday-parks-nz-booking-guide.html">holiday park booking tutorial</a> for step-by-step reservation tips.</p>
          <p><strong>Iwi, hapū, and community-managed locations</strong>, such as marae campgrounds or showgrounds, offer cultural experiences and support local guardianship. Respect tikanga, pay koha where requested, and confirm availability in advance through KiwiCamping contact links.</p>

          <h2>North Island regions overview</h2>
          <p>Northland's coastline is dotted with DOC and council sites like Ōpārara Estuary Campsite, Tapu Bay Reserve, and Spirits Bay / Kapowairua. Many require self-contained certification and close during significant cultural events. KiwiCamping flags those blackout periods.</p>
          <p>Auckland balances regional parks like Wenderholm (bookable via Auckland Council) with long-stay holiday parks such as Ōrewa Beach TOP 10. Waikato and the Coromandel offer beachfront DOC gems at Opito Bay, while Taupō and Rotorua mix geothermal holiday parks with lakeside freedom nodes.</p>
          <p>The central plateau highlights include Whakapapa Holiday Park for Tongariro adventures and free council spots around Turangi. On the east coast, Gisborne and Hawke's Bay blend surf-side DOC camps with council-managed car parks. In Wellington, urban travellers rely on Evans Bay Motorhome Park and ferry-friendly holiday parks.</p>

          <h2>South Island regions overview</h2>
          <p>Marlborough's Queen Charlotte Drive features DOC and concession sites such as Mistletoe Bay Eco Village and Momorangi Bay. Nelson Tasman blends Golden Bay council sites with iconic DOC campgrounds in Abel Tasman National Park.</p>
          <p>West Coast wanderers should queue up Lake Mahinapua DOC Campsite and Gillespies Beach. Canterbury offers braided river freedom zones alongside holiday parks in Tekapo and Kaikōura. Cross-reference flood alerts using KiwiCamping's weather integrations.</p>
          <p>Otago and Southland boast icons such as Moke Lake, Curio Bay, and Monowai Campsite. Remember that Milford Sound and Fiordland largely require DOC bookings. Freedom camping isn't permitted close to the fiords.</p>
          <p>For scenic inspiration and photo-ready picks, skip ahead to our <a href="top-scenic-campsites-nz.html">Top 25 scenic campsite list</a>, which links directly into the KiwiCamping map.</p>

          <h2>Legal guardrails and planning help</h2>
          <p>Freedom camping is legal only where permitted and often requires CSC vehicles with a fixed toilet. Always follow on-site signage. It overrides any app or PDF. Visit local <strong>i-SITE</strong> and DOC visitor centres for the latest closures and alerts.</p>

          <h2>Seasonal access and weather considerations</h2>
          <p>Winter brings snow and ice to alpine passes. Many DOC roads close temporarily after heavy snow in Arthur’s Pass, Lindis Pass, or the Desert Road. Use KiwiCamping weather alerts and road closures to time your travel, and pack according to our <a href="camping-packing-list-nz.html">regional packing list</a>.</p>
          <p>Summer popularity can overwhelm coastal DOC sites. Book early and keep holiday park backups handy. Autumn and spring shoulder seasons are perfect for quieter stays but can deliver unpredictable rain. Keep KiwiCamping’s offline lists up to date so you can pivot when cyclones or nor’westers hit.</p>
          <p>Always respect rāhui and local tikanga. KiwiCamping highlights cultural restrictions. If a site shows a rāhui banner, choose an alternative and spread the word to other travellers.</p>

            <h3>Where to camp FAQ</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>How do I know if a DOC campsite needs to be booked?</dt>
              <dd>Check the KiwiCamping listing. If it links to DOC Booking, the site requires a reservation during peak months. Many basic sites remain first-come, first-served.</dd>
              <dt>Can I alternate between freedom sites and holiday parks?</dt>
              <dd>Yes. Many travellers free camp for one or two nights, then reset at a holiday park for showers and laundry. Plan those resets using our <a href="holiday-parks-nz-booking-guide.html">booking guide</a>.</dd>
              <dt>What is the best way to discover new regions?</dt>
              <dd>Start with KiwiCamping’s region filters, browse our <a href="top-scenic-campsites-nz.html">scenic campsite list</a>, and layer in itinerary ideas from the <a href="two-week-camper-itinerary-nz.html">two-week camper itinerary</a>.</dd>
