            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Open fires are illegal in many regions without a permit during restricted or prohibited fire seasons. Gas cookers are usually allowed, but always verify local alerts.</p></div>

          <h2>Open fires vs gas cookers</h2>
          <p>Open fires include campfires, wood burners, and charcoal grills. They require permits in restricted fire seasons and are banned outright in prohibited periods. Gas cookers with an on/off valve are typically allowed, but some councils ban them on high-risk days.</p>
          <p>Check the Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) website or tap the fire widget in KiwiCamping for real-time status. If in doubt, cook with a gas stove on a stable surface away from vegetation.</p>

          <h2>Seasonal fire danger and permits overview</h2>
          <p>New Zealand operates three fire seasons: open, restricted, and prohibited. During restricted seasons you must apply for a permit via FENZ. KiwiCamping links to the permit form for each region and displays the season status in campsite cards.</p>
          <p>Permits specify fire type, location, and safety measures. Carry a printed or digital copy to show rangers. Remember that national park rules can be stricter than regional policies.</p>

          <h2>Region by region quick notes</h2>
          <p><strong>Northland &amp; Auckland:</strong> Coastal winds escalate fire danger. Expect restricted seasons through summer and early autumn. Use gas only unless FENZ issues a permit.</p>
          <p><strong>Central Plateau:</strong> Volcanic soils dry quickly. Campsites near Tongariro often sit in restricted zones even in spring.</p>
          <p><strong>Nelson-Tasman &amp; Marlborough:</strong> High sunshine hours mean frequent total fire bans. Many DOC sites provide gas BBQ shelters—book early.</p>
          <p><strong>Canterbury &amp; Otago:</strong> Nor’west winds cause sudden danger spikes. Check KiwiCamping alerts daily and consider alternative cooking methods.</p>
          <p><strong>Southland &amp; West Coast:</strong> Rain lowers risk, but storms can topple trees and create fuel loads. Follow ranger instructions.</p>

          <h2>Alternatives when fires are banned</h2>
          <p>Use gas cookers, induction hotplates with inverter setups, or pre-cooked meals. Carry cold-soak options in case total bans include camp stoves. Refer to our <a href="camping-packing-list-nz.html">packing list guide</a> for stove recommendations and fire-safe gear.</p>
          <p>If you rely on communal camp kitchens, prioritise holiday parks or DOC camps with electric facilities—search KiwiCamping filters for “kitchen” or “BBQ shelter.” Cross-reference with regional weather in the <a href="nz-camping-seasons-weather-sandflies.html">seasonality guide</a>.</p>

            <h3>Fire rules FAQ</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>How do I know the current fire season?</dt>
              <dd>Check FENZ or KiwiCamping’s fire status indicator on each site listing. Update daily during summer.</dd>
              <dt>Are gas BBQs allowed during a total fire ban?</dt>
              <dd>Sometimes. Some prohibitions still allow gas with automatic shutoff, but others ban all flames. Always read the specific notice.</dd>
              <dt>What happens if I light an illegal fire?</dt>
              <dd>You may face fines, liability for suppression costs, and potential prosecution. Councils take bans seriously after recent wildfires.</dd>
