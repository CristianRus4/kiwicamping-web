          <h2>Open fires vs gas cookers</h2>
          <p>Open fires include campfires, wood burners, and charcoal grills. They require permits in <em>Restricted</em> fire seasons and are banned in <em>Prohibited</em> seasons. Gas cookers with an on/off valve are usually allowed, but some areas restrict all flames during extreme risk. Always check current notices.</p>
          <p>Check the Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) website or tap the fire widget in KiwiCamping for real-time status. If in doubt, cook with a gas stove on a stable surface away from vegetation.</p>

          <h2>Seasonal fire danger and permits overview</h2>
          <p>NZ operates three seasons: <strong>Open</strong> (no permit needed for permitted fire types), <strong>Restricted</strong> (permit required), and <strong>Prohibited</strong> (no open fires). Apply for permits via FENZ. Many DOC camps forbid solid-fuel fires year-round. Assume gas-only unless a designated fireplace/sign says otherwise.</p>
          <p>Permits specify fire type, location, and safety measures. Carry a printed or digital copy to show rangers. Remember that national park rules can be stricter than regional policies.</p>

          <h2>Region by region quick notes</h2>
          <p><strong>Northland &amp; Auckland:</strong> Coastal winds escalate fire danger. Expect restricted seasons through summer and early autumn. Use gas only unless FENZ issues a permit.</p>
          <p><strong>Central Plateau:</strong> Volcanic soils dry quickly. Campsites near Tongariro often sit in restricted zones even in spring.</p>
          <p><strong>Nelson-Tasman &amp; Marlborough:</strong> High sunshine hours mean frequent total fire bans. Many DOC sites provide gas BBQ shelters. Book early.</p>
          <p><strong>Canterbury &amp; Otago:</strong> Nor’west winds cause sudden danger spikes. Check KiwiCamping alerts daily and consider alternative cooking methods.</p>
          <p><strong>Southland &amp; West Coast:</strong> Rain lowers risk, but storms can topple trees and create fuel loads. Follow ranger instructions.</p>

          <h2>Alternatives when fires are banned</h2>
          <p>Use gas cookers, induction hotplates with inverter setups, or pre-cooked meals. Carry cold-soak options in case total bans include camp stoves. Refer to our <a href="camping-packing-list-nz.html">packing list guide</a> for stove recommendations and fire-safe gear.</p>
          <p>If you rely on communal camp kitchens, prioritise holiday parks or DOC camps with electric facilities. Search KiwiCamping filters for “kitchen” or “BBQ shelter.” Cross-reference with regional weather in the <a href="nz-camping-seasons-weather-sandflies.html">seasonality guide</a>.</p>

            <h3>Fire rules FAQ</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>How do I know the current fire season?</dt>
              <dd>Check <a href="https://www.checkitsalright.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checkitsalright.nz</a> (FENZ) or KiwiCamping’s fire status indicator on each site listing. Re-check daily in summer.</dd>
              <dt>Are gas BBQs allowed during a total fire ban?</dt>
              <dd>Sometimes. Some Prohibited seasons still allow gas with automatic shutoff, but others ban all flames. Always read the specific notice.</dd>
              <dt>What happens if I light an illegal fire?</dt>
              <dd>You may face fines, liability for suppression costs, and potential prosecution. DOC and councils take bans seriously after recent wildfires.</dd>

          <h2>Safety basics for permitted fires</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Use only designated fireplaces/fire pits where allowed.</li>
            <li>Keep fires small (around &lt;0.5&nbsp;m in size) and at least 3&nbsp;m from vegetation/structures.</li>
            <li>Have water on hand, never leave a fire unattended, and fully extinguish with water. Don’t bury embers.</li>
          </ul>
