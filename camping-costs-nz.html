          </header>

          <div class="definition-box" role="note">
            <p><strong>Snapshot:</strong> Budget travellers combining DOC camps, freedom sites, and occasional holiday parks spend roughly NZD $65–$95 per day for two people, excluding flights.</p></div>

          <div class="download-banner">
            <p>Track your actual spend inside KiwiCamping by logging nightly fees, fuel stops, and grocery receipts.</p>

          <h2>Holiday park prices, DOC fees, free options</h2>
          <p>Holiday parks often price per adult: expect roughly NZ$20–$30 per adult off‑peak and NZ$30–$50+ in peak; some operators price per site. Cabins add ~$80+ per night. See our <a href="holiday-parks-nz-booking-guide.html">booking guide</a> for loyalty discounts and typical card surcharges (2–2.5%).</p>
          <p>DOC camps range from free <em>Basic</em> sites to roughly NZ$10-$20 (<em>Standard</em>) and ~NZ$20-$28 (<em>Serviced/Scenic</em>). Freedom camping can be $0 but often requires a certified self-contained vehicle. Illegal camping can cost <strong>$400</strong> in fines. Use KiwiCamping to note any permit fees or donation boxes.</p>
          <p>Staying mostly at DOC camps? Consider the <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-stay/stay-at-a-campsite/booking-and-paying/campsite-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOC Campsite Pass</a> (not all sites covered; Great Walks excluded).</p>

          <h2>Fuel, ferry, food, gear amortization</h2>
          <p>Fuel remains a major cost. Budget roughly $0.30-$0.50 per kilometre depending on vehicle and season. The Cook Strait ferry for a camper plus two people can be ~$300-$400 each way in peak.</p>
          <p>Food expenses vary with cooking habits: self-catered meals cost $15–$25 per person per day, while dining out can double that. Gear amortisation (tents, stoves, sleeping bags) might add $5–$10 per person per day when spread over a season.</p>

          <h2>Hidden costs to factor in</h2>
          <p>Card surcharges (2–2.5%), booking fees on some platforms, and higher peak rates can add up. If you plan to freedom camp regularly, include self‑containment certification costs in your budget. Always allow a buffer for weather‑related changes.</p>

          <h2>Peak vs shoulder season budgets</h2>
          <p>Peak season (Dec-Feb) increases accommodation and ferry prices by ~20-40%. Fuel demand also rises. Shoulder seasons offer discounts, fewer crowds, and easier bookings. Winter saves money but requires investment in warm gear. See the <a href="camping-packing-list-nz.html">packing checklist</a>.</p>
          <p>Balance free nights with paid stays to access facilities. KiwiCamping’s trip planner makes it easy to visualise spend across two-week itineraries.</p>

          <h2>Example budgets for solo, couple, family</h2>
          <p><strong>Solo traveller (14 days):</strong> $550 accommodation (mix of DOC and occasional holiday park), $420 food, $450 fuel, $100 activities = approx $1,520.</p>
          <p><strong>Couple (14 days):</strong> $700 accommodation, $560 food, $600 fuel, $300 activities = approx $2,160 ($77 per person per day).</p>
          <p><strong>Family of four (14 days):</strong> $1,200 accommodation (powered sites + cabins), $1,120 food, $700 fuel, $500 activities = approx $3,520.</p>
          <p>Use KiwiCamping’s notes to record actual receipts and adjust for exchange rates if you are visiting from overseas.</p>
