  faqEyebrow: "A few straight answers",
  faqTitle: "Good questions. Clear answers.",
  faqIntro: "Straight answers about travelling with KiwiCamping.",
  faq1q: "What is KiwiCamping?",
  faq1a: "KiwiCamping is an iPhone app for finding places to camp and stay around New Zealand. It bundles a directory of 4,500+ places so the details stay readable without reception, and it turns the ones you save into a road trip with an ordered route, dates, notes and to-dos.",
  faq2q: "What places are included?",
  faq2a: "More than 4,500 places: DOC campsites, backcountry huts, holiday parks and other bookable stays, freedom camping areas, public dump stations and day-use places across both islands.",
  faq3q: "Does it work without reception?",
  faq3a: "The place directory is bundled with the app, so names, categories, descriptions, fees, facilities and conditions stay readable well beyond signal. Live services such as weather, routing, Street View, photos and provider pages still need a connection.",
  faq4q: "Can I plan a multi-stop road trip?",
  faq4a: "Yes, and it is the app's main feature. Add places as stops, drag them into order, attach a date and arrival notes to each one, see the driving distance leg by leg and across the whole trip, open directions to the next stop, check the weather at each one, tick stops off as visited and keep the packing list beside the itinerary. Itinerary details can sync to Calendar.",
  faq5q: "What are collections?",
  faq5a: "Two kinds. Smart collections (Liked, Starred, Want to visit, Visited, Pins and All saved) fill themselves as you mark places. On top of those you can create your own named collections with an icon and notes for a region, a season, a vehicle or a shortlist.",
  faq6q: "Can I filter for free camps or self-contained sites?",
  faq6a: "Yes, and combinations of them. Filters cover place type, fee, minimum rating, online booking, region and detailed facility and access features, so “free camping areas with toilets and drinking water near Queenstown” is a single query.",
  faq7q: "What is on a place screen?",
  faq7a: "Photos, a description, opening hours, fees, terms and conditions, facilities grouped by type, current alerts, ratings, contact and booking details, weather, Street View where coverage exists, directions, and nearby alternatives.",
  faq8q: "What map views are there?",
  faq8a: "A standard map and a satellite view built on Apple's flyover imagery, which you can tilt and rotate for real 3D terrain. Street View, built on Apple's Look Around imagery, gives the street-level view from the place screen.",
  faq9q: "Can I see prices in my own currency?",
  faq9a: "Yes. Choose your currency in settings and set the conversion rate, and reported costs are shown in that currency alongside the New Zealand dollar figure.",
  faq10q: "Can I book a campsite in KiwiCamping?",
  faq10a: "Open the booking details for a place to reach its provider and check live availability, prices and terms.",
  faq11q: "Are camping rules the same across New Zealand?",
  faq11a: "No. National law, council bylaws, conservation rules and individual site conditions can all apply. Always follow current signs, land-manager directions, fire restrictions and official alerts.",
