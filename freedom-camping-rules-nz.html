          <h2>What freedom camping means in NZ context</h2>
          <p>Freedom camping lets travellers stay overnight in certain public places without paying a campsite fee. In New Zealand that privilege comes with obligations: you must comply with the Freedom Camping Act 2011, respect local bylaws, and leave no trace. The term covers parking in lay-bys, lakeside reserves, or council-designated car parks, not private farmland or national park huts.</p>
          <p>KiwiCamping tags every legal spot and pairs it with the relevant rule excerpt so you can prove compliance. Tap the site card, scroll to “Council Source,” and follow the PDF or map overlay before setting up for the night.</p>

          <h2>National rules vs council bylaws</h2>
          <p>Nationally, you need a certified self-contained vehicle unless the council explicitly allows non-self-contained setups. The Department of Internal Affairs enforces penalties up to $400 for breaching the Act. Councils layer their own bylaws on top, defining restricted zones, maximum stay lengths, and prohibited activities.</p>
          <p>The fastest way to confirm restrictions is with the <a href="index.html#map-of-legal-sites">KiwiCamping legal sites map</a>. Councils such as Queenstown-Lakes update bylaws every season. KiwiCamping pushes those updates within hours, while static PDFs on council sites may hide in obscure directories.</p>
          <p>Remember that conservation land has its own rules under the Reserves Act and DOC management plans. If a reserve is marked “no overnighting,” you must move on even if a council map seems permissive.</p>

          <h2>Self-contained vehicle requirements overview</h2>
          <p>From December 2024, most urban and popular tourism areas require vehicles to meet the new self-containment standard with a fixed toilet. Portable toilets no longer qualify unless you are in a council-designated exception zone. Certification involves meeting water storage, wastewater, and venting requirements verified by a Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board (PGDB) approved certifier.</p>
          <p>Need a refresher on the hardware requirements? Jump to our <a href="self-contained-vehicles-nz.html">self-contained vehicle explainer</a> for diagrams, checklists, and enforcement scenarios. Always carry your warrant card and display the new blue compliance label.</p>

          <h2>Regional quick reference, North Island</h2>
          <p><strong>Northland:</strong> Expect designated zones only. KiwiCamping lists every Far North and Whangārei District site with stay limits—usually 2 nights. Rangers actively patrol over summer.</p>
          <p><strong>Auckland:</strong> Freedom camping is heavily restricted. Most sites require self-contained certification and adherence to 6pm–9am time slots. Viaduct Harbour, Piha, and many bays are prohibited—check the KiwiCamping bylaw snippets.</p>
          <p><strong>Waikato &amp; Bay of Plenty:</strong> Mix of council reserves and holiday park alternatives. Tauranga allows limited sites, while Rotorua offers lakeside spots with strict signage. Always verify with the <a href="best-nz-camping-apps.html">KiwiCamping app</a> map filter before settling in.</p>
          <p><strong>Gisborne &amp; Hawke’s Bay:</strong> East Coast councils allow specific beaches but often mandate overnight permits. KiwiCamping provides links where you can request those permits online.</p>
          <p><strong>Taranaki, Manawatū-Whanganui, Wellington:</strong> Coastal parking is often limited to self-contained vehicles with 48-hour maxima. Wellington City enforces no-camping zones around the CBD; use KiwiCamping to find legal harbour spots instead.</p>

          <h2>Regional quick reference, South Island</h2>
          <p><strong>Tasman &amp; Nelson:</strong> Permit-only zones dominate. Rangers check stickers at Kaiteriteri and Golden Bay daily in summer. KiwiCamping highlights permit kiosks and i-SITE offices with direct links.</p>
          <p><strong>Marlborough &amp; Kaikōura:</strong> Marlborough Sounds have DOC campsites rather than pure freedom sites—book ahead. Kaikōura has council-run car parks with fixed capacity; check live availability in KiwiCamping before arriving late.</p>
          <p><strong>Canterbury:</strong> Christchurch limits freedom camping to a handful of car parks. Mackenzie and Waitaki Districts are more permissive but require self-contained proof. KiwiCamping’s enforcement notes flag hotspots where fines are common.</p>
          <p><strong>Otago:</strong> Queenstown-Lakes and Central Otago councils enforce strict zones. Expect early morning checks. Dunedin City offers a balance of coastal reserves with 2-night limits—arrive before dusk to secure a space.</p>
          <p><strong>Southland &amp; Fiordland:</strong> Freedom camping near Milford Sound is prohibited; use DOC campsites instead. Southland District allows specific gravel lay-bys with GPS coordinates listed inside KiwiCamping.</p>

          <h2>How to check local signage on arrival</h2>
          <p>Even when you have researched online, final authority rests with posted signage. Pull in, scan for freedom camping boards, and photograph them for your records. Signage overrides outdated PDFs or map layers.</p>
          <p>KiwiCamping’s check-in workflow helps: open the site, confirm you see the same rules, and report discrepancies. The moderation team triages updates daily so fellow travellers and councils benefit.</p>
          <p>If signage contradicts what the app says, follow the sign. Then send feedback through the app so we can investigate. Councils sometimes install temporary restrictions after floods or events, and KiwiCamping flags those as “temporary closures” once confirmed.</p>
