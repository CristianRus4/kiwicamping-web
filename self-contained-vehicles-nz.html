            <p><strong>Self-contained vehicle definition:</strong> A vehicle that meets NZS 5465:2023 with permanently plumbed fresh water, wastewater, and toilet systems capable of supporting occupants for at least three days without discharging waste.</p>

          <h2>What self-contained certification means</h2>
          <p>Certification proves your vehicle can manage water and waste without relying on public facilities. As of December 2024, only vehicles with fixed toilets connected to a holding tank qualify for blue warrants. Portable cassette toilets no longer meet the standard except in limited rural exemptions.</p>
          <p>Approved testing officers inspect your freshwater storage (minimum 12 litres per person), wastewater capacity (20% greater than freshwater), sinks, vents, and signage. KiwiCamping lists PGDB-approved inspectors regionally so you can book ahead.</p>

          <h2>Fixed toilet vs portable, water and waste standards overview</h2>
          <p>The updated regulations require a fixed toilet with direct plumbing to a sealed blackwater tank. Cassette systems must be bolted in place and vented externally. Freshwater tanks need secure caps and food-grade hoses. Wastewater outlets must be labelled and capped.</p>
          <p>Greywater tanks require external vents and a 3-day capacity. Use food-safe hoses and ensure the sink drains pass the bucket test during inspection. For design tips, consult manufacturers or community builds featured inside KiwiCamping.</p>

          <h2>How enforcement typically works</h2>
          <p>Compliance officers from councils or the national freedom camping team can request to see your self-containment warrant, inspection certificate, and matching vehicle registration. KiwiCamping recommends storing digital copies in your trip notes.</p>
          <p>Failure to produce documentation or displaying an outdated green sticker can lead to $200 fines or being moved on. Hotspots like Queenstown, Rotorua, and Christchurch run frequent checks, especially during peak summers.</p>

          <h2>Implications for freedom camping</h2>
          <p>Most urban freedom sites now demand blue-warranted vehicles. Rural councils may allow non-certified campers in designated areas, but you must remove wastewater daily. Cross-reference our <a href="freedom-camping-rules-nz.html">freedom camping rules by region</a> guide to stay legal.</p>
          <p>Even when self-contained, you must dispose of waste responsibly. Plan stops using the <a href="dump-stations-nz.html">dump station map</a> and keep greywater valves sealed while driving.</p>

              <dt>How long does certification last?</dt>
              <dd>Certificates are valid for four years, provided no major modifications occur. Keep proof of inspection in your vehicle.</dd>
              <dt>Can I retrofit a van to be self-contained?</dt>
              <dd>Yes, but the toilet must be permanently plumbed. Budget for certified installers, venting hardware, and inspection fees.</dd>
              <dt>What happens if my sticker is damaged?</dt>
              <dd>Contact your issuing authority for a replacement and carry the certificate as backup until the new sticker arrives.</dd>
