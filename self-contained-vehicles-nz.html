          <h2>What self-contained certification means</h2>
          <p>Certification proves your vehicle can manage water and waste without relying on public facilities. Under changes enacted from 2023, new certifications for freedom camping require a <strong>fixed toilet</strong> and are issued with a <strong>green Certified Self-Contained (CSC) warrant</strong>. Portable toilets no longer qualify for new CSC certifications used for freedom camping.</p>
          <p>PGDB-approved testing officers inspect your freshwater storage (commonly ≥12&nbsp;L per person), wastewater capacity (≥20% greater than freshwater), fixed toilet installation, vents, and compliant hose/cap fittings. Use KiwiCamping to find inspectors and save your documents.</p>

          <h2>Green vs blue: transition rules</h2>
          <p><strong>Green warrant:</strong> The current certification recognised for freedom camping where CSC is required.</p>
          <p><strong>Blue sticker:</strong> Legacy certification under the old standard. Valid only until its printed expiry or <strong>7&nbsp;June&nbsp;2026</strong> (whichever comes first) for freedom camping.</p>

          <h2>Costs, paperwork, and renewal</h2>
          <p>Typical costs include an inspection fee (often NZ$60–$150), a government levy (~NZ$120), and any parts/labour to meet requirements. Certificates generally last four years or until plumbing/layout is modified. Keep your <strong>warrant card</strong> in the vehicle and display the green sticker as instructed.</p>

          <h2>Why certification matters for access</h2>
          <p>Most council freedom camping areas require CSC vehicles, especially in towns and popular destinations. Certification unlocks more legal options and helps avoid $400 infringement fees for non-compliance.</p>

          <h2>Fixed toilet vs portable, water and waste standards overview</h2>
          <p>The updated regulations require a fixed toilet with direct plumbing to a sealed blackwater tank. Cassette systems must be bolted in place and vented externally. Freshwater tanks need secure caps and food-grade hoses. Wastewater outlets must be labelled and capped.</p>
          <p>Greywater tanks require external vents and a 3-day capacity. Use food-safe hoses and ensure the sink drains pass the bucket test during inspection. For design tips, consult manufacturers or community builds featured inside KiwiCamping.</p>

          <h2>How enforcement typically works</h2>
          <p>Compliance officers from councils or the national freedom camping team can request to see your self-containment warrant, inspection certificate, and matching vehicle registration. KiwiCamping recommends storing digital copies in your trip notes.</p>
          <p>Failure to produce documentation or displaying an outdated green sticker can lead to $200 fines or being moved on. Hotspots like Queenstown, Rotorua, and Christchurch run frequent checks, especially during peak summers.</p>

          <h2>Implications for freedom camping</h2>
          <p>Most urban freedom sites now demand blue-warranted vehicles. Rural councils may allow non-certified campers in designated areas, but you must remove wastewater daily. Cross-reference our <a href="freedom-camping-rules-nz.html">freedom camping rules by region</a> guide to stay legal.</p>
          <p>Even when self-contained, you must dispose of waste responsibly. Plan stops using the <a href="dump-stations-nz.html">dump station map</a> and keep greywater valves sealed while driving.</p>
