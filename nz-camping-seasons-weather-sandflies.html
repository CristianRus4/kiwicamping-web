          <h2>Seasonality by island and region</h2>
          <p><strong>North Island:</strong> Summer (Dec–Feb) brings warm temps in Northland and the Coromandel, though humidity can trigger afternoon showers. Autumn offers calm, settled weather in Hawke’s Bay and Taranaki, making it ideal for campervan roadies. Winter is mild near Wellington and Taranaki but cooler inland.</p>
          <p><strong>South Island:</strong> Summer offers long daylight, but alpine UV is intense. Pack sun shelter. Autumn colours shine in Central Otago, while spring delivers wild weather swings. Winter sees snow on passes such as Lindis and Arthur’s. Carry chains and follow live alerts in KiwiCamping.</p>

          <h2>Rain, wind, and temperature bands</h2>
          <p>Expect 20–30°C highs in Northland during summer, while Southland ranges from 16–22°C. Winter lows can drop below freezing inland. Westerly fronts bring heavy rain to Fiordland and the West Coast year-round, whereas Canterbury and the east coast stay drier.</p>
          <p>Monitor wind forecasts. Canterbury nor’westers and Wellington southerlies can impact tent setup. KiwiCamping overlays Apple Weather data on each site, so you get hourly wind gust predictions.</p>

          <h2>Sandflies: where and how to cope</h2>
          <p>Sandflies are most intense on the West Coast, Fiordland, and bushy coastlines in warmer months. Use proven repellents with <strong>DEET or picaridin</strong>, wear long sleeves/pants (especially at dawn and dusk), and choose breezier camps. Wind suppresses activity. Fine-mesh window screens help a lot.</p>
          <p>Inside KiwiCamping, look for sandfly notes on each listing. The community frequently updates severity reports, so you can plan stops with lower pressure.</p>

          <h2>Clothing and gear selection by season</h2>
          <p>Summer: breathable shirts, sun hats, and quick-dry shorts. Bring lightweight thermals for alpine nights. Autumn: add softshell jackets and waterproof layers. Conditions shift quickly. Winter: full thermal base layers, down insulation, waterproof boots, and heated blankets for powered sites. Spring: mix of summer gear and waterproof shells for sudden showers.</p>
          <p>Cross-reference our <a href="camping-packing-list-nz.html">packing list</a> for itemised checklists, and weave seasonal insights into the <a href="two-week-camper-itinerary-nz.html">two-week camper itinerary</a>. Note: many DOC camps are open year-round, but high-altitude access can be snowed-in in winter.</p>

          <h2>Daylight hours and peak season</h2>
          <p>Expect long summer evenings (sunset ~9&nbsp;pm or later) and early winter nights (dark by ~5&nbsp;pm). Peak camping season is roughly December–February (plus Easter). Book popular spots in advance or arrive early.</p>
